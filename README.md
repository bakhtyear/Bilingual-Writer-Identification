A CNN-based system to identify writers from Bengali and English handwritten characters. I have collected handwriting samples from my classmates. Then I have captured those documents using the phoneâ€™s camera. Then those photos were cropped, labeled, and augmented. Those images were divided into train data and test data. Then this data set was fed to an existing classifier model to see initial results. After Ablation study and HyperParameter tuning a CNN model with an accuracy of 98.36% was proposed.

In the code section, you will find all the codes from resizing the images to training the model. In the 'Extras' folder use the 'gpu_async' code to make TensorFlow use Nvidia GPU and CUDA.
